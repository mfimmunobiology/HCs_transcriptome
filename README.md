Transcriptomic Analysis of Hofbauer Cells from Human Placental Tissue Infected with HIV, CMV, and ZIKV

Summary: This study involves the isolation of Hofbauer cells from human placental tissue at different gestation periods and their infection with HIV, CMV, and ZIKV. The transcriptomic profiles of these infected cells were analyzed using RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways.

Overall design: Hofbauer cells were isolated from human placental tissue and infected with HIV, CMV, and ZIKV. RNA was extracted, and RNA-sequencing was performed to analyze transcriptomic changes.
